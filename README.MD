# Pseudo Compiler
This is a compiler I am working on using JS transpilers. The motivation behind this is to help students of O - Levels CIE get used to with writing Pseudo code. This is a completely hobby based project and I have no idea how far will I go with this ! 

Any support will be really appreciated.
